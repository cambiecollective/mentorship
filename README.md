# mentorship

## Origin

* **Thread**: https://community.vancouvertech.com/t/mentorship-how-did-you-get-it-do-you-want-it-what-would-you-want-out-of-mentorship/26/5

## Goals

* Set up a mentorship community in Vancouver
* Create a structure of mentorship for and by all levels of development
* Having people in the community to sign up to be mentors (in either type), mentees, or both

## Types of mentorship

1. career mentorship - defining a “compass”, knowing where to go. That’s likely to be answered by running ad-hoc interviews of people farther along the intended path who will have more experience there.
2. technical mentorship - moving forward faster. Having an ongoing mentor / mentee relationship is likely to be best there.
